# Installation and Running the Tasks

## 1. Install Dependencies
To get started, first install the necessary dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 2. Running Task 1

``` bash
cd task_1
python execute_task_1.py
```

This script will sequentially run the following:

- **Task 1.1** (`pnl_calculations.py`): Calculating total buy volume and sell volume.
- **Task 1.2** (`pnl_calculations.py`): Calculates PnL (Profit and Loss).
- **Task 1.3** (`app.py`): Starts a Flask application running an API endpoint.

## 2.1 Testing the API (Task 1.3) 

When Task 1.3 is executed, the Flask server will start, and an API endpoint will be available for testing.

Once you are done testing the endpoint, press CTRL+C in the terminal to stop the Flask server and terminate the process.
